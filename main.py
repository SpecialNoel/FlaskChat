# -------------------------------- Routes --------------------------------
'''
Definition: A route is a function that defines how the server responds to a request from a client
           which is usually associated with a URL path (i.e. /chat, /about, etc.). A route can
           return a response to the client, such as an HTML page, a JSON object, or a status code.
'''     

# Home route (/): The homepage and landing page of the application.
# In the homepage, the user can enter their name, and either create a chat room, or join one with a room id.
# Handle requests to this route with the GET and POST HTTP methods.
